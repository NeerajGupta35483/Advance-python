    "**Q2. What are the two most popular try statement variations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The Popular try statement variations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **try,except**\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **try,except,finally**\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **try,except,finally,else**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **try** block is used to check code for exceptions during runtime.\n",
    "ie code inside try block will execute completely when there is no error\n",
    "in the program. Whereas the code inside except block will execute\n",
    "whenever the program encounters some error in the\n",
    "preceeding **try** block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas the code enters the **else** block if and only if the try clause\n",
    "does not raise and exception. The code in the **finally** block will\n",
    "execute irrespective of exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What is the purpose of the raise statement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** **raise** statement is used to trigger an exception explicitly,\n",
    "if a certain condition is not as per requirement of\n",
    "programmer. **raise** statement helps in triggering exception as per\n",
    "programming logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it\n",
    "like?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** There are few assertions that programmer always want to be true\n",
    "to avoid code failure. This type of requirement is fulfilled\n",
    "by **assert** statement. This statement takes a boolean condition output\n",
    "of which is True, Further Program Executes. if output of assert\n",
