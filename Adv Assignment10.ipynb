    "Q1. What is the difference\n",
    "between \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_ and \\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** **\\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_** is used to find an attribute of a\n",
    "class. It raises an **AttributeError** of it fails to find an attribute\n",
    "of a class. **\\_\\_getattr\\_\\_** is implemented latter if AttributeError\n",
    "is generated by **\\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_**, but for\n",
    "this **\\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_** and **\\_\\_getattr\\_\\_** both has to be\n",
    "defined in same class. If no attribute is\n",
    "found, **\\_\\_getattr\\_\\_** returns a default value. So key difference is\n",
    "that **\\_\\_getattr\\_\\_** is called for attributes that don't actually\n",
    "exist on a class.\n",

    "**Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The differences between Properties and Descriptors is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:** With Properties we can bind getter, setter and delete\n",
    "functions together with an attribute name, using the built-in property\n",
    "function or @property decorator. When we do this, each reference to an\n",
    "attribute looks like simple, direct access, but involes the appropriate\n",
    "function of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Descriptor:** With Descriptor we can bind getter, setter and delete\n",
    "functions into a seperate class. we then assign an object of this class\n",
    "to the attribute name in our main class. When we do this, each reference\n",
    "to an attribute looks like simple, direct access but invokes an\n",
    "appropriate function of descriptor object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What are the key differences in functionality between getattr and\n",
    "getattribute, as well as properties and descriptors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The Key Differences\n",
    "between \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_, \\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_, Properties and\n",
    "Descriptors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\_\\_getattr\\_\\_**: Python will call this method whenever you request\n",
    "an attribute that hasn't already been defined\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_** : This method will invoked before looking at\n",
    "the actual attributes on the object. Means,if we\n",
    "have \\_\\_getattribute\\_\\_ method in our class, python invokes this\n",
    "method for every attribute regardless whether it exists or not.\n",
