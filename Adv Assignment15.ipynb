    "1. What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Some New Features Added in Python 3.8 Version are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Walrus Operator**: This operator is used to assign and return a value\n",
    "in the same expression. This removes the need for initializing the\n",
    "variable upfront. The major benefit of this is it saves some lines of\n",
    "code. It is also known as The **Walrus Operator** due to its similarity\n",
    "to the eyes and tusks of a walrus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**yield** and **return** statements do not require parentheses to return\n",
    "multiple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversed works with a dictionary. The built-in method **reversed()** can\n",
    "be used for accessing the elements in the reverse order of insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dict comprehensions** have been modified so that the key is computed\n",
    "first and the value second.\n",
    "\n",
    "**importlib_metadata** is a new library added in the Python’s standard\n",
    "utility modules, that provides an API for accessing an installed\n",
    "package’s metadata, such as its entry points or its top-level name.\n",
    "\n",
    "f-strings now support = , to make string interpolation easy. Python 3.8\n",
    "allows the use of the above-discussed assignment operator and equal\n",
    "sign **(=)** inside the f-strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the three-argument form of **pow()**, when the exponent is -1, it\n",
    "calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the given value\n",
    "\n",
    "The **csv.DictReader** now returns instances of dictionary instead of\n",
    "a **collections.OrderedDict**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you miss a comma in your code such as a = **\\[(1, 2) (3, 4)\\]**,\n",
    "instead of throwing **TypeError**, it displays an informative Syntax\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ans:** In Python, the term monkey patch refers to making dynamic (or\n",

    "**3. What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The Differences between a Shallow Copy and deep copy are as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object is copied using **copy()**, it is called **shallow\n",
    "copy** as changes made in copied object will also make corresponding\n",
    "changes in original object, because both the objects will be referencing\n",
    "same address location.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object is copied using **deepcopy()**, it is called **deep\n",
    "copy** as changes made in copied object will not make corresponding\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ans:** In Python, the highest possible length of an identifier is 79\n",

    "-   The generator yields one item at a time and generates item only when\n",
    "    in demand. Whereas, in a list comprehension, Python reserves memory\n",
