    "1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** An abstract class/superclass can be considered as a blueprint\n",
    "for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be\n",
    "created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class\n",
    "which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas an abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does\n",
