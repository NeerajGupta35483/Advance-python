    "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A Python class is like an outline/blueprint/mold for creating a\n",
    "new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change\n",
    "while working through the code. Every time a class object is\n",
    "instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is\n",
    "initiated from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas in Python, Modules are simply files with the **. py** extension\n",
    "containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python\n",
    "Program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a\n",
    "code library or a file that contains a set of functions/Classes that you\n",
    "want to include in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. How do you make instances and classes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** For creating a class instance. we call a class by its name and\n",
    "pass the arguments which its **\\_\\_init\\_\\_** method accepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** vishwak = employee('Male',20000), Here vishwak is an\n",
    "instance of class employee with attriubutes 'Male' and 20000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas for creating a class, we use the Class keyword. Class keyword is\n",
    "followed by classname and semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Here Employee is a class created with class keyword with\n",
    "arguments gender and salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "class Employee: def \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self, gender,salary): self.gender =\n",
    "gender self.salary = salary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Where and how should be class attributes created?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Class attributes or Class level Attributes belong to the class\n",
    "itself. these attributes will be shared by all the instances of the\n",
    "class. Hence these attributes are usually created/defined in the top of\n",
    "class definiation outside all methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** In the below code we are defining a class attribute called\n",
    "no_of_wheels which will be shared by all the instances of the class Car\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car: no_of_wheels = 4; \\# this is a class attribute def\n",
    "\\_\\_init\\_\\_(self,color,price,engine): self.color = color \\# All this\n",
    "are instance attributes self.price = price self.engine = engine\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Where and how are instance attributes created?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Instances attributes are passed to the class when an object of\n",
    "the class is created. Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are\n",
    "not shared by all objects of the classs. instead each object maintains\n",
    "its own copy of instance attributes at object level. whereas incase of\n",
    "class attributes all instances of class refer to a single copy. Usually\n",
    "instance attributes are defined within the **\\_\\_init\\_\\_** method of\n",
    "class\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** In the below sample code we are creating a class Car with\n",
    "instance varaibles color, price, engine, which will be provided when an\n",
    "instance of class Car is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car: def \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self,color,price,engine): self.color = color\n",
    "\\# All this are instance attributes self.price = price self.engine =\n",
    "engine\n",
    "\n",
    "nexon_ev = Car('Indigo Blue', 1400000, 'electric') safari = Car('Pearl\n",
    "White',2100000, 'petrol')\n",
    "\n",
    "nexon_ev, safari are both the instances of class Car with different\n",
    "instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. What does the term \"self\" in a Python class mean?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** **self** represents the instance of the class (it represents\n",
    "the object itself). By using the “self” keyword we can access the\n",
    "attributes and methods of the class with in the class in python. It\n",
    "binds the attributes with the given arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In \\[1\\]:\n",

    "**Q6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Python Classes handle operator overloading by using special\n",
    "methods called **Magic methods**. these special methods usually begin\n",
    "and end with \\_\\_ (double underscore)  \n",
    "**Example:** Magic methods for basic arithmetic operators are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   \\+ -> \\_\\_add\\_\\_()\n",
    "\n",
    "-   \\- -> \\_\\_sub\\_\\_()\n",
