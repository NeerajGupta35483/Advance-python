    "Q1. Explain the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax with\n",
    "visual terms in as few words as possible. What is the bare minimum\n",
    "effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one?\n",
    "What characters or characters can you introduce or change?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The Main difference between Greedy and Non Greedy Match Syntax\n",
    "is The Greedy Match will try to match as many repetitions of the\n",
    "quantified pattern as possible Whereas The Non Greedy Match will try to\n",
    "match as few repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible\n",

    "if you're looking for a non-greedy match but the only one available is\n",
    "greedy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The Greedy Match will try to match as many repetitions of the\n",
    "quantified pattern as possible. The Non Greedy Match will try to match\n",
    "as few repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible. If only Non\n",
    "Greedy Match is available, we can use other filtering or pattern\n",
    "matching methods of regex and further identify the required pattern.\n",

    "does not do any replacement, is the use of a nontagged group likely to\n",
    "make any practical difference?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** In this Case The Non Tagged Group will not make any diffrence\n",
    "in this case.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Here in the below Code Snippet . decimal is not tagged or\n",

    "**Ans:** Positive Lookahead allows to add a condition for **what\n",
    "follows**. Negative Lookahead is similar, but it looks behind. That is,\n",

    "**Q7. What is the benefit of referring to groups by name rather than by\n",
    "number in a standard expression?**\n",

    "**Ans:** **re.findall()** module is used to search\n",
